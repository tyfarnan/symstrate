# Program Synthesis via Symbolic Regression: A Novel Approach

## Abstract

This research explores the intersection of program synthesis, symbolic regression, and arithmetic circuit recovery. We investigate whether techniques from automatic theorem proving and algorithm discovery can be leveraged for program synthesis by encoding programs as polynomial constraint systems. Our approach focuses on learning and composing arithmetic circuits through a bottom-up synthesis strategy.

## Research Objectives

1. Develop a framework for translating programs into arithmetic circuits and polynomial constraints
2. Create generative benchmarks for evaluating symbolic regression in program synthesis
3. Investigate the feasibility of mining and composing symbolic abstractions for program recovery

## Methodology

### Forward Pipeline
- Develop a restricted Python DSL for program representation
- Implement AST-based analysis for circuit generation
- Convert programs to arithmetic circuits via DAG traversal
- Generate polynomial constraint systems

### Backward Pipeline
- Create mechanisms for program generation from polynomial constraints
- Implement algebraic rewiring techniques to preserve semantic equivalence
- Encourage discovery of underlying circuit structures
- Enable syntax diversity in generated programs

## Implementation Roadmap
