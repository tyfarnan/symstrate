# ARC AGI Explorer

An exploratory project investigating hypergraphs as a datastructure for program search in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge.

## Overview

This project explores a novel approach to program synthesis using:
1. Hypergraphs to represent the search space of program transformations
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently prune the search space
3. Self-play verification to test and refine transformation hypotheses

The current implementation serves as a proof-of-concept for investigating how an AI agent might "play" with input/output examples to discover and verify transformation rules.

## Current Implementation

### Components

- `arc_dsl.py`: A domain-specific language (DSL) generated by Claude 3 Opus (O3) that defines primitive grid transformation operations
- `arc_function_seq.json`: Initial sequences of DSL functions generated by O3 for testing
- `program_synthesis.py`: Synthesizes and tests programs from function sequences
- `generate_images.py`: Visualization tool for examining task examples

### Visualization System

Each visualization pairs input and output grids to aid in pattern recognition.

### Program Synthesis Pipeline

1. Loads function sequences from JSON
2. Maps sequences to executable DSL functions
3. Tests against training examples
4. Reports success rates and failed cases

## Vision & Future Work

### Self-Play Framework

The goal is to develop an iterative self-play framework where an agent can:
1. Analyze input/output examples
2. Generate hypotheses about transformations
3. Express these as function sequences
4. Verify hypotheses against training data
5. Refine its approach based on results

### LLM-Guided Search

Future iterations will use LLMs to:
- Analyze patterns in successful transformations
- Generate promising function sequences
- Prune unlikely paths in the search space
- Learn from verification results

### Hypergraph Search Space

The project explores hypergraphs as a natural representation for:
- Program transformation states
- Function composition relationships
- Search space navigation
- Pattern discovery

### Verification Pipeline

Plans for an enhanced verification system:
1. Test function sequences on training examples
2. Generate metrics for transformation success
3. Feed results back to the search process
4. Build a knowledge base of working patterns

## Research Goals

1. Investigate hypergraphs as a program search datastructure
2. Develop methods for LLM-guided search space pruning
3. Create a self-improving system for pattern discovery
4. Build verifiable approaches to program synthesis
